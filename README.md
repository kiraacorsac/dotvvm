![TFS Build: ](https://rigantitfs.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/build/definitions/8dfab054-d6f0-471d-88c2-4f230395cdd1/4/badge)

**DotVVM** is an ASP.NET framework that lets you build **line-of-business applications** and **SPAs** without writing tons of JavaScript code. You only have to write a viewmodel in C# and a view in HTML. DotVVM will do the rest for you.

**DotVVM** brings full **MVVM** experience and it uses **KnockoutJS** on the client side. It handles the client-server communication, validation, localization, date & time formatting on the client side, SPAs and much more. 

It is open source, it supports both OWIN and ASP.NET Core and it runs on .NET Framework, .NET Core and Mono.
It also offers a free extension for Visual Studio 2015 with IntelliSense and other useful features which make the development really easy and productive.

How It Works?
-------------

The **Views** in DotVVM use HTML syntax with __controls__ and __data-bindings__.

```html
<div class="form-control">
  <dot:TextBox Text="{value: Name}" />
</div>
<div class="form-control">
  <dot:TextBox Text="{value: Email}" />
</div>
<div class="button-bar">
  <dot:Button Text="Submit" Click="{command: Submit()}" />
</div>
```

The **ViewModels** are plain C# objects. You can call public methods from the **View**.

```C#
public class ContactFormViewModel
{
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public string Email { get; set; }
  public void Submit()
  {
    ContactService.Submit(Name, Email);
  }
}
```

You just need to know C#, HTML and CSS. For most scenarios you don't have to write any JavaScript code.
